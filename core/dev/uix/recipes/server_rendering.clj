  "This recipe shows how to use UIx's server-side rendering capability in JVM Clojure.

  `uix.core/render-to-string` takes an element and synchronously returns
  HTML string that can be sent back to the client.

  `uix.core/render-to-stream` does the same but provides a way
  to consume HTML string in chunks as they are produced, effectively
  pushing at you a stream of HTML. This can be used to stream markup
  back to the client when serialization takes significant amount of time."

  "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.")
